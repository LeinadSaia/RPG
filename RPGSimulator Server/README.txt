    Welcome to RPG Simulator!
    To configure your character sheet, you can access data/sheet.json.
You can add, remove or edit data inside, but do not change description
names. (it is bounded to the program code.)

    Character avatar should be 150x150, or similar ratios, otherwise it might be displayed strangely.
To change it, just replace the file: data files\images\character.png.

    attributeRollDice and skillRollDice are used to determine with what "dice" you are rolling a specific
attribute or skill. For an example, you can change Strength roll if you modify the number that has the same
position as the attribute.
