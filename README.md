# RPGSim
 A Java simulator inspired by Cellbit's "Ordem Paranormal" series.

Instructions:

WASD - Move around.

F1 - Open character sheet.

O - Open asset (or object) creation panel.


Once you created an object, you can grab it and change its position, scale and rotation.


\[ \] - Rotate the object.

\< \> - Flip the object.

\- \+ - Scale the object.

As for the server, it can watch over other players' sheet and change it. You can also roll attributes or skills by simply clicking on its name.

This application still have a lot of bugs and optimizations to be made, so if you are interested in helping me, feel free to request a pull :)
